# Methods are function within class
# Create class claeed Employee, within the method we have name, salary, raise and monthly salary methods.
# so basically set_name is a function/method that have self and new_name attributes


class Employee:
    def set_name(self, new_name):
        self.name = new_name

    def set_salary(self, new_salary):
        self.salary = new_salary 

    def give_raise(self, amount):
        self.salary = self.salary + amount

    # Add monthly_salary method that returns 1/12th of salary attribute
    def monthly_salary(self):
        return self.salary / 12
    
emp = Employee()
emp.set_name('Korel Rossi')
emp.set_salary(50000)

# Get monthly salary of emp and assign to mon_sal
mon_sal = emp.monthly_salary()

# Print mon_sal
print(mon_sal)
